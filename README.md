# Treblle for .NET Core

  
  

Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box you get:

* Real-time API monitoring and logging

* Auto-generated API docs with OAS support

* API analytics

* Quality scoring

* One-click testing

* API managment on the go

* and more...

  

## Requirements

* .NET Core 6.0

  

## Getting started

Create a FREE account on <https://treblle.com> to get an API key and Project ID.

  

You can install Treblle .NET Core via NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Treblle.Net.Core
```


  

You will be prompted to enter your Treblle API key and Project ID. Your settings will be saved in ```app.config``` and you can always edit them there.

Here is an example:

  

```xml
<configuration>
	<appSettings>
		<add  key="TreblleApiKey"  value="{Your_API_Key}"  />
		<add  key="TreblleProjectId"  value="{Your_Project_Id}"  />
	</appSettings>
</configuration>
```

Treblle for .NET 6.0 supports both Minimal APIs and standard Controllers.

### Using Minimal APIs

You'll need to add Treblle middleware to your ```WebApplication```:
```csharp
app.UseTreblle();
```

It's recommended that you add this line before any other middleware. 
If you want to use a custom exception handler, you can disable the Treblle Exception Handler explicitly in options:

```csharp
app.UseTreblle(new TreblleOptions() { ExceptionHandlingEnabled = false });
```

Now you can specify which endpoints you want Treblle to track by using the ```.UseTreblle()``` extension in the Minimal API endpoint definition.
Example:

```csharp
app.MapGet(...).UseTreblle()
```

### Using Controllers

You'll need to add this middleware to your ``` Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) ``` method in ```Startup.cs```:

  
  

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
	context.Request.EnableBuffering();
	await next(context);
});
```

Now you can specify which endpoints you want Treblle to track by adding this simple attribute to any API controller or method:

  

```csharp
[Treblle]
```

  

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Just by adding a few lines of code you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.

  
  

### Need to hide additional fields?

If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass property names you want to hide by adding the ```AdditionalFieldsToMask``` property to your ```app.config``` file like in the example below.

  

```xml
<configuration>
	<appSettings>
		<add  key="TreblleApiKey"  value="{Your_API_Key}"  />
		<add  key="TreblleProjectId"  value="{Your_Project_Id}"  />
		<add  key="AdditionalFieldsToMask"  value="secretField,highlySensitiveField"  />
	</appSettings>
</configuration>
```

## Error handling

If there are any errors, they will be logged in ```TreblleLog.txt```.
