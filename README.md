Treblle is a lightweight SDK that helps Engineering and Product teams build, ship & maintain REST based APIs faster.

## How Treblle Works
Once youâ€™ve integrated a Treblle SDK in your codebase, this SDK will send requests and response data to your Treblle Dashboard.

In your Treblle Dashboard you get to see real-time requests to your API, auto-generated API docs, API analytics like how fast the response was for an endpoint, the load size of the response, etc.

Treblle also uses the requests sent to your Dashboard to calculate your API score which is a quality score thatâ€™s calculated based on the performance, quality, and security best practices for your API.

> Visit [https://docs.treblle.com](http://docs.treblle.com) for the complete documentation.

## Security

### Masking fields
Masking fields ensure certain sensitive data are removed before being sent to Treblle.

To make sure masking is done before any data leaves your server [we built it into all our SDKs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#fields-masked-by-default).

This means data masking is super fast and happens on a programming level before the API request is sent to Treblle. You can [customize](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#custom-masked-fields) exactly which fields are masked when youâ€™re integrating the SDK.

> Visit the [Masked fields](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields) section of the [docs](https://docs.sailscasts.com) for the complete documentation.


## Get Started

1. Sign in to [Treblle](https://app.treblle.com).
2. [Create a Treblle project](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#creating-a-project).
3. [Setup the SDK](#install-the-SDK) for your platform.

### Install the SDK

You can install Treblle .NET Core via NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Treblle.Net.Core
```

### Configuring Treblle

You will need to add the required service by calling `AddTreblle` and providing your [API key](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard#accessing-your-api-key) and [Project ID](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#project-id).

Here's an example of configuring the Treblle services and fetching the configuration values from the application settings:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTreblle(
    builder.Configuration["Treblle:ApiKey"],
    builder.Configuration["Treblle:ProjectId"]);
```

Next you'll need to add the `TreblleMiddleware` by calling `UseTreblle` on the `WebApplication` instance.
You can optionally configure the use of the exception handler middleware.

```csharp
app.UseTreblle(useExceptionHandler: true);
```

**Using Treblle with Controllers**

Now you can specify which endpoints you want Treblle to track by adding this simple attribute to any API controller or method:

```csharp
[Treblle]
```

**Using Treblle with Minimal APIs**

To tell Treblle to track your Minimal API endpoints, you have to apply `UseTreblle` to your endpoint definition:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/", () => "Treblle is awesome")
    .UseTreblle();
```

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project.

> See the [docs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/integrations/net-core) for this SDK to learn more.

### Masking Additional Fields

If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass property names you want to hide as a CSV string to the `AddTreblle` call:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTreblle(
    builder.Configuration["Treblle:ApiKey"],
    builder.Configuration["Treblle:ProjectId"],
    "secretField,highlySensitiveField");
```

### Running Treblle only in production

If you want to run Treblle only in production, you can rely on the environment variables, or use a similar approach via your application config.

```csharp
if (app.Environment.IsProduction())
{
    app.UseTreblle();
}
```
